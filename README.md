- Overview

    This Jupyter notebook is designed for extracting and analyzing art-related data using various machine learning and data processing techniques. It integrates APIs and libraries to perform tasks such as vector database creation, retrieval-based question answering, and conversational AI modeling.

- Libraries and Dependencies

    **LangChain: Used for building language models and incorporating AI-driven conversational abilities.**

    **OpenAI: Leveraged for advanced language model APIs.**

    **Dataclasses-JSON: For easy JSON (de)serialization of data classes.**

    **ChromaDB: Implemented for managing vector databases, facilitating fast retrieval of similar items.**

    **Transformers and Tokenizers: Utilized from Hugging Face for natural language processing tasks.**

- Main Functionalities

    API Key Configuration: Sets environment variables for API keys.

    Environment Setup: Installs and sets up necessary libraries and dependencies.

    Data Preparation: Processes and prepares art-related data for analysis.

    Vector Database Creation: Implements vector databases using DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) models for efficient information retrieval.

    Conversational AI Setup: Sets up a retrieval-based QA system and conversational AI model for interactive querying.

    File Handling: Demonstrates file operations like reading, writing, and vector database management.
